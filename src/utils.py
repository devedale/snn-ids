General Project Utilities
This module contains common utility functions that are used across different
parts of the SNN-IDS project. This includes functionalities like file operations,
artifact archiving, etc.

It also includes global seeding utilities to ensure reproducibility across
Python's random module, NumPy, and TensorFlow when available.
