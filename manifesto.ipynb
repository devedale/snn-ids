    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a didactic and executable manifesto on the intersection of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), data anonymization, and network intrusion detection. We posit that traditional Deep Learning models, while effective, present a significant computational overhead and a lack of biological plausibility. SNNs offer a promising, energy-efficient alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical and often overlooked aspect of training intrusion detection systems is the treatment of sensitive information within network traffic data, specifically IP addresses. Standard practice often involves discarding or naively replacing these addresses, potentially losing valuable network topology information. This research explores the impact of a sophisticated, cryptography-based anonymization technique, Crypto-PAn, on the performance of SNN-based intrusion detection models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Research Question:** How does IP address anonymization using the Crypto-PAn algorithm affect the performance of a Spiking Neural Network-based IDS compared to using plaintext IP addresses and naive anonymization techniques?"

A key feature of this dataset is the inclusion of raw network traffic data, which is essential for our analysis of IP address anonymization. We will reference the seminal paper on this dataset:\n",

    "1.  **Data Preprocessing and Anonymization:** We will implement a configurable preprocessing pipeline that allows for three distinct modes of IP address handling: plaintext, fully anonymized (hashed), and Crypto-PAn anonymized.\n",
    "2.  **Model Architecture:** We will focus on a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model, implemented using a TensorFlow-compatible library. For comparison, we will also provide implementations for traditional GRU and LSTM models.\n",
    "3.  **Experimentation and Evaluation:** We will conduct a comparative analysis, training each model type on the three different versions of the dataset and evaluating their performance using standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)."

    "\n",
    "Crypto-PAn (Cryptography-based Prefix-preserving Anonymization) is an algorithm that anonymizes IP addresses in a way that preserves the network prefix structure. This is crucial for our research, as it allows the model to potentially learn from the network topology without being exposed to the actual IP addresses.\n",
